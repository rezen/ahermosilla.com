I realized I needed a place to archive some of the things I've learned so that
other people, including my future self, can learn from my experiences! I write
about nodejs, devops, tools, security and randonmess! Many of my posts will be 
"living posts" with content updating as I learn more on the topic!

A quick background, I'm curious developer with an education in design. I started
working, designing websites and apps and enjoyed trying to figure out what
made things work. I've never stopped trying to figure out how things work and don't 
plan on stopping!
