As a developer, it is beneficial to understand basics of design
and how people digest information. You may think to yourself that you will never
have to create a visual interface, but the reality is even code
has a visual aspect which has impact on its consumption. A deeper
understanding of visual perception can positively impact your code!

#### Principles
Design is a mature industry with centuries of application and study. There are many
tried and true principles and concepts that you should apply and keep in mind when
creating designs. Also understanding the elements of design and how they relate 
together allows you to put the pieces together in a cohesive fashion

#### Typography
A vast amount of information that is communicated is in the form of text.
The visual form of this text affects how the information presented is consumed.
If letters are very too close together or too far apart, reading can be hindered. 
If margin between lines of text is too big, discerning if information belongs together
can become difficult. Typography is about addressing these sorts of problems with
text and presenting text in a legible readable format.

## Links
There are a number of resources to help developer types understand basics of design. 
I've also included articles that cover the the concept of information hierarchy,
which is very important tool for aiding the digestion of information.

## Showcases
Reading about principles & concepts is great but may feel abstract. 
Seeing finished products where these principles are applied helps tie 
the concepts together.
